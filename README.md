# PROBLEMS
In INDIA where nearly 300 million people have thier own businesses , many of them can not take them to the international market. Some of the main reasons are
•	Lack of trust between the seller and private organisations.
•	Extra charges which are currently being taken by third party organisations in private firms.
•	Difficulty in documentation and other formalities.
•	Lack of knowledge about the demand of their product in International Market.
•	Difficulty in dealing with modern technology.
•	BUYER does not trust the product supplier




# SOLUTIONS
1) There has always been a gap between private firms and local vendors. DAK GHAR NIRAYAT KENDRA being a government organisation will insure that no injustice is done to any buyer and supplier who are using their services.
2) Currently




4) As it has been consistently seen in the market that there is always a supply , demand imbalance in trade. A supplier who does not have an idea about the demand of his product in the outer world can not supply his products throughout the year .To overcome this problem we have developed a Machine Learning model which will predict the demads of a certain product  in a particular month so that the supplier can manufacture his products accordingly.
# ABOUT MACHINE LEARNINIG MODEL
Dataset for trainig -https://www.niryat.gov.in
The machine learning model uses randomforest regressor in order to predict the demand of a product in the given month. It has been trained on various parameters which include the sales of the product in  past years. The use of random forest regresor ensures that no extreme bias and overfitting occurs in the model.
The model also gives an idea about how a certain change in the demand can provide great insights to the seller .
